### Introduction 

1. I am creating this project for my WW2 re-enactment group. We have a private facebook page and are in need of a website. The function would be to attract recruitment, inform WW2 enthusiast's of our event schedule and encourage event holders to consider inviting us to their events. We recieve a lot of attention during events, and in response we have handed out business cards to enthusiast's with our details on. We have picked up a few recruits in this manner, and have processed the recruit by inviting them to our next event and giving them 3 events without paying any subs. This enable the recruit, time to decide if they want to remain in the group, if not then they can be directed to one of the other groups in the Northern World War 2 Association, which we are affiliated to.
   1.1. The 3 event period also give the group a chance to evaluate the new recruit, we are a 
friendly team and welcome new recruits warmly. However we have strict rules regarding authenticity during events and are strictly a non-political group. Recruits are buddied by one or more , and are encourged to ask anybody, in the group to assist if they cannot answer a question from a public member. They are also supplied with spare kit until they can buy their own. During te event hours there is no modern clothing worn, no mobile phones used in sight of the public and only realistic period food can be eaten, which is cooked in the camp, drinks must be consumed from period water bottles/cups.
   1.2 The public are entertained from touring the camp site, watching firing displays of blank
 firing weapons, and watching a staged battle with blank firing weapons and pyrotechnics. As a German unit we have an advantage to interact with the public on occasion, such as asking for identity documents and searching for concealed items. It works well, and gives them an exciting experience.

### UX

### Project Goal

The main goals are to increase recruitment and make the group visible to more Event Holders. We have 37 members but not all attend regularly, on average we field around 10-12 members at an event. The target for recruitment 5+ per season. 

### Development and Business Goals

 All members are enthusiastic about re-actment but some do not like engaging the public face to face, prefering to stay in the background. This is fine as not everyone it the same. They stay in the background, apart from firing displays and battles, performing camp duties. Most of our female members enjoy this and demostrate, cooking and general chores around the camp, as it was in the time period. We have a radio set and field telephones which is manned by two female member on the camp. Other male members demonstrate off duty activities such as cleaning boots, weapons and other equipment. I myself prefer engaging the public. Both options compliment each other and produce an interest from the public, seeing the activity that was present on and around a rear front camp in WW2.
    
The idea of camp life and engaging the public running hand in hand, creates a memorable and nostalgic experience. This is a good
selling point for potenial event holders to include us in their events. We are known in the large event circuit, as part of the Northern World War 2 Association. However we are looking for some smaller events, to attend independently. There is a huge interest in re-enactment events and in some of the larger ones, there are crowds of thousands. Some of the specialised weekends in small towns see the vast majority dressing in period dress. We engage the public and answer questions about uniforms, equipment and weapons. The interest is vast and people take photos with you all the time. We have a private Facebook account, so this website would increase the availablity to keen people who would like to join or read about the unit we portray. We have a lot of interest during events as to which one we will attend next, so listing our events and dates will help the interested people to see this information and chose which events they can attend. The goal is to recruit and retain 3-5 in a year. One factor that could prevent a recruit joining is the cost of clothing and equipment, which is very expensive. We navigate this problem by loaning group equipment to them until they can buy their own. Most of us have gathered more than we need so can loan out the access or sell items to the recruit, usually half price as it is secondhand. Most people buy an item or more, if affordable, every month. The members of the public who dress up at large events have told us about their local events. This enables us to obtain information about these events and who runs them. This can provide a two way communication link, either we ring the event holder or by giving our site address to them they can read our About section, and reccommend to the Event holder to access the site with aview of hiring the group.

## Scope

The project will comprise of user friendly interactions, with each menu item containing simple recognisable functions. Events will have a scroll bar with dates and location. Contact will contain two buttons, one for recruitment and one for event holders, each will contain a button with a phone number and one for e-mails, and will be available on mobile phones, laptops and Desktops. About 4gd and the history of Grossdeustchland Div will contain text, video's and images.
